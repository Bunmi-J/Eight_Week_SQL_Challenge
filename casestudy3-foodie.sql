--D1 How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi? we can use metrics like
--customer growth or revenue growth
--D2- What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
-- subcriber growth and retention growth- how many active subscribers and how many
--users continues to subscribe after trial period and for how long

/*D3 --What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse
further to improve customer retention?
Ans- 1000 canceled after trial period. 546 downgraded to basic, 539 upgraded to monthly pro and 258 upgraded to annual pro.
overall % of users cancelling after trial is high, the figure for both monthly 
and annual pro is higher than users that downgraded*/

who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the 
survey? 
Ans-On a scale of 0 -10 where 0 is not at all satisfied and 10 is very satisfied
How satisfied are you with the service? How satisfied are you with the food
content? could you give reason for cancellation */

/* D5 What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
Ans- A month free after 6 months continuous subscriptions. Yearly bonus point 
or incentives for active loyal users.
